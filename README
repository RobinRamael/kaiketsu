# sudoku

A simple and not-that-smart-yet sudoku solver.

## Usage

use the solve-grid (core.clj) and read-grid (grid.clj) to point to a file containing a sudoku looking something like this:

5 0 0 9 0 0 0 2 0
0 0 1 0 8 0 0 6 0
0 4 0 0 0 2 3 1 0
0 0 0 7 0 0 6 0 1
2 0 0 6 3 0 0 0 8
0 8 7 4 0 1 5 3 0
0 5 0 0 0 0 1 0 7
4 0 9 1 0 0 0 0 0
0 6 0 0 0 9 0 0 3

With zeros for the empty places.
